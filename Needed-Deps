You will need the following to make use of this suite.
Please note, I may have overlooked some dependencies.
If you find a dependency that I neglected to mention,
please let me know so it can be added here.

You will need internet access.
You will need sudo or access to root.
You will need the following software for I2P and the I2PBrowser:
* xterm
* bash
* wget
* sed
* grep
* tar


You will need the following software for iMule:
* glib/gtk-1.2.10 (package names like glib and glibdev
  or glib-devel, gtk and gtkdev or gtk-devel or similar) or gtk2
  (package names correspond to gtk ones)
* libexpat (package name should be expat)
* gettext
* wxWidgets-2.8 or greater,
  linked against glib/gtk-1.2.10 is needed (package names wxGTK and
  wxGTK-devel or similar).
* libc6 (>= 2.11)
* libcrypto++9
* libgcc1
* libgeoip1
* libstdc++6
* libupnp6 (>= 1:1.6.13)
* libwxbase2.8-0 (>= 2.8.12.1)
* libwxgtk2.8-0 (>= 2.8.12.1)
* zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4)

Your distro may already have most of these dependencies. The main possible
problem you will encounter is with running iMule. If you try to run iMule
and it will not start, make sure you have all of the above dependencies.

I2P and the I2PBrowser should run with what is installed on most distros.

You can find wxWidgets here if it's not in your system package repository:
