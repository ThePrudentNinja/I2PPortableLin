You will need the following to make use of this suite.
Please note, I may have overlooked some dependencies.
If you find a dependency that I neglected to mention,
please let me know so it can be added here.

You will need internet access.
You will need sudo or access to root.
You will need the following software for I2P and the I2PBrowser:
* xterm
* bash
* wget
* sed
* grep
* tar

Your distro may already have most of these dependencies.

I2P and the I2PBrowser should run with what is installed on most distros.
